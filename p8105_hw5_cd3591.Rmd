Problem 1
```{r}
# Write a function to check whether there are duplicate birthdays in the group; and return TRUE or FALSE based on the result.
birthday_shared = function(n_people){
  birthdays = sample(1:365, n_people, replace = TRUE)
  any(duplicated(birthdays))
}

# simulate 10000 times and calculate the prob
set.seed(1122)
birthday_sim_results =
  tibble(n_people = 2:50) %>% # for each group size between 2 and 50
  mutate(
    prob_shared = map_dbl(n_people,
      ~ mean(replicate(10000, birthday_shared(.x))) # run this function 10000 times & averaging across the 10000 simulation runs
    )
